The goal of this project was to implement a RPN calculator. The user would enter numbers and operations in postfix order. For instance, "3 4 + " would yield 7.

As a part of this project, I used the Stack and LinkedStack data structures. (LinkedStack uses a linked list as the underlying implementation).

To access the calculator, go to "main/java/hw4" and see the "Calc.java" file.
